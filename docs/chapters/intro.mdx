Microchips power phones, laptops, AI accelerators, cars, and cloud servers. Each advanced chip hosts billions of transistors wired together in nanoscale patterns.

:::note Definition: Lithography
Lithography transfers a designed pattern (on a photomask/reticle) onto a wafer coated with a light-sensitive film (photoresist). Development and etch turn that pattern into real structures in silicon and metals.

:::tip Thought Experiment
If you scaled the tiny chip features up to readable text, a modern GPU could "fit" the equivalent of entire book collections — from the Harry Potter series to the English Wikipedia — etched with atomic-level precision.

## Why EUV?

<AnimatedBlock>

To keep shrinking features, we need shorter wavelengths and better optics. EUV uses 13.5 nm light — far shorter than conventional deep ultraviolet (DUV) at 193 nm — enabling much finer features.

## What's inside a modern chip?

<AnimatedBlock>

At a high level, chips integrate three big things:

- **Transistor layers**: billions of tiny switches that compute
- **Interconnect layers**: thin metal wires that connect switches  
- **Power and I/O layers**: routes that bring power in and signals out

## Quick Q&A

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not keep using 193 nm DUV for everything?</strong></summary>

<AnimatedBlock>

It becomes increasingly hard to pattern ever-smaller features with longer wavelengths. You can use tricks (multiple patterning), but complexity and cost rise rapidly. EUV at 13.5 nm makes the smallest features more straightforward.

</AnimatedBlock>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are transistors so small?</strong></summary>

<AnimatedBlock>

Smaller devices switch faster and use less energy, enabling higher performance and lower power. But they demand extreme precision in manufacturing.
