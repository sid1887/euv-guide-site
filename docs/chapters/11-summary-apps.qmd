- Why chips matter: Everything digital rides on them.  
- Why EUV: Shorter wavelength + higher NA = finer features.  
- How it works: Tin plasma emits 13.5 nm; multilayer mirrors steer it; reflective masks carry patterns; precision stages align and expose; chemistry develops features.  
- Where it’s going: High-NA EUV, better resists, greener tools, higher throughput.
