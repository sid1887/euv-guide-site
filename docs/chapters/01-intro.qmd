title: "1 — Introduction: Why Microchips Matter"
---

Microchips power phones, laptops, AI accelerators, cars, and cloud servers. Each advanced chip hosts billions of transistors wired together in nanoscale patterns.

### Definition: Lithography
Lithography transfers a designed pattern (on a photomask/reticle) onto a wafer coated with a light-sensitive film (photoresist). Development and etch turn that pattern into real structures in silicon and metals.

### Thought Experiment
If you scaled the tiny chip features up to readable text, a modern GPU could “fit” the equivalent of entire book collections — from the Harry Potter series to the English Wikipedia — etched with atomic-level precision.

### Why EUV?
To keep shrinking features, we need shorter wavelengths and better optics. EUV uses 13.5 nm light — far shorter than conventional deep ultraviolet (DUV) at 193 nm — enabling much finer features.

### What’s inside a modern chip?
At a high level, chips integrate three big things:

- Transistor layers: billions of tiny switches that compute
- Interconnect layers: thin metal wires that connect switches
- Power and I/O layers: routes that bring power in and signals out

### Takeaway
EUV lithography is a key enabler of the chips that drive AI, mobile, and cloud.

### Quick Q&A
<details>
<summary>Why not keep using 193 nm DUV for everything?</summary>
It becomes increasingly hard to pattern ever-smaller features with longer wavelengths. You can use tricks (multiple patterning), but complexity and cost rise rapidly. EUV at 13.5 nm makes the smallest features more straightforward.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are transistors so small?</summary>
Smaller devices switch faster and use less energy, enabling higher performance and lower power. But they demand extreme precision in manufacturing.
