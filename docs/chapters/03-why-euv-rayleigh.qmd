title: "3 — Why EUV Is Needed: Wavelength, NA, and Rayleigh"
---

Smaller wavelength and larger numerical aperture (NA) mean smaller printed features. This is captured by Rayleigh’s criterion:

$$ CD = k_1 \cdot \frac{\lambda}{NA} $$

EUV reduces wavelength from 193 nm to 13.5 nm while High-NA increases NA, both improving CD per Rayleigh and reducing multi-patterning burdens [@Pease2007; @ASML_HighNA].

### Marker-Tip Analogy
Shorter wavelengths are like finer marker tips — you can draw thinner lines.

### Notes on Parameters
- Typical process factor: k₁ ≈ 0.3–0.4  
- EUV wavelength: λ = 13.5 nm  
- Production NA values: 0.33 (today), 0.55 (High-NA)

### Takeaway
Moving from 193 nm DUV to 13.5 nm EUV — and increasing NA — is how we keep printing at the nanoscale.
:::

### What is k₁ and why isn’t it zero?
The factor k₁ accounts for process/optical constraints like coherence, illumination shape, mask topology, and resist behavior. Typical values are ~0.3–0.4 in production. Advanced computational lithography can push it lower, but not to zero.

### Practical NA Ranges

| Technology | NA (typical) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| DUV immersion | 1.35 | Water immersion; 193 nm |
| EUV (current) | 0.33 | 13.5 nm; 4× reduction |
| High-NA EUV | 0.55 | 13.5 nm; anamorphic optics |

### Beyond Rayleigh
Even with the same CD by Rayleigh, stochastic effects (photon shot noise, secondary electrons) and resist limitations can dominate. Dose, illumination, and pattern layout co-optimization are crucial.
