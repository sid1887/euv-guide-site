title: "7 â€” Wafer Stages and Alignment (TWINSCAN)"
---

Modern scanners use a dual-stage architecture: one stage exposes while the other aligns and prepares the next wafer. Magnetic levitation, interferometry, and electrostatic chucks deliver sub-nanometer positioning.

### Takeaway
Parallelism boosts productivity: while one wafer is exposed, the next is measured and aligned.
:::

### Stage Mechanics and Metrology
- Long-stroke stage: handles coarse motion over large distances
- Short-stroke stage: fine positioning with nm accuracy over small ranges
- Interferometers measure position with sub-nm resolution; environmental isolation reduces vibration

### Electrostatic Chucks (ESC)
ESCs clamp wafers with electric fields to avoid mechanical distortion; cooling channels manage thermal load and maintain flatness.
