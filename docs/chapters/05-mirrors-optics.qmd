title: "5 — Multilayer Mirrors and Projection Optics"
---

Glass absorbs EUV, so optics are reflective multilayer mirrors (Mo/Si) tuned to 13.5 nm. Peak reflectivity is ~70% per mirror, so EUV needs a very bright source to compensate for multiple bounces.

### Takeaway
Higher NA captures larger angles of light for better resolution, but requires bigger optics, smaller fields, and tougher engineering.

### Multilayer Manufacturing
Mo/Si stacks are grown by sputtering with sub-nanometer precision. Interface roughness and interdiffusion must be minimized to keep high reflectivity. Ru capping layers protect the stack; thermal stability is critical during operation.

### High-NA Anamorphic Imaging
To achieve NA 0.55, High-NA optics often use different magnifications in X and Y (e.g., 4× and 8×), shrinking field size in one dimension to maintain image quality while accommodating the larger cone of rays.

See @fig-proj-opt for the projection optics and @fig-high-na for a High-NA concept rendering. The multilayer stack in @fig-ml-sem highlights the periodic Mo/Si structure that makes EUV reflection possible.
