<AnimatedBlock>

Photolithography is like projecting a stencil onto photosensitive paint. A mask carries the pattern; optics image it onto photoresist on the wafer; development reveals the pattern; etch transfers it into materials.

</AnimatedBlock>

:::note Definition: Photoresist
A polymer film that changes solubility when exposed to light. Positive resists become more soluble where exposed; negative resists become less soluble.

## The Lithography Cycle

:::tip Takeaway
Photolithography turns circuit blueprints into physical nanostructures using light and chemistry, one layer at a time.

## Step Types and Modes

<AnimatedBlock>

- **Steppers vs Scanners**: Scanners sweep the slit image over the wafer for higher throughput and better imaging control.
- **Exposure dose**: Energy per unit area on resist (e.g., 20–50 mJ/cm² for EUV). Too low and features won't form; too high and they blur.
- **Focus/exposure matrix (FEM)**: Process windows are characterized by sweeping focus and dose to map printability.

## Overlay and Alignment

<AnimatedBlock>

Overlay is the alignment between layers — typically controlled to a few nanometers. Alignment marks are measured by metrology optics; corrections are applied by the stage and optics.

## Wafer Shot Map

<AnimatedBlock>

The wafer is divided into exposure fields (shots), each containing multiple die. The shot map optimizes throughput while maintaining quality.
