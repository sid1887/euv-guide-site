EUV masks are reflective multilayer mirrors with absorber patterns, typically 4× larger than the wafer image and reduced in projection.

### What is a Photomask?
A precision master carrying circuit patterns. EUV masks use Mo/Si multilayers with a Ru cap and a tantalum-based absorber to block EUV locally.

### Takeaway
Mask perfection is crucial: any defect replicates across all chips on a wafer.
:::

### Pellicles and Contamination
EUV pellicles are ultra-thin membranes that keep particles off the mask surface during exposure. They must be transparent at 13.5 nm yet mechanically robust and thermally stable.

### Absorber Choices and Edge Profiles
Tantalum-based absorbers offer good EUV absorption. Edge profiles and sidewall angles impact imaging due to shadowing and phase effects; computational OPC corrects for these.

| Topic | Note |
|---|---|
| Inspection | Actinic inspection at 13.5 nm is ideal but challenging |
| Repair | Focused ion beam and localized deposition techniques |
| Cleaning | Plasma and chemical methods must preserve multilayers |
