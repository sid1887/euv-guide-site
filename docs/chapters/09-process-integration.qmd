title: "9 — Process Integration: Layer-by-Layer Chip Build"
---

Chips are built by repeating pattern-transfer cycles across dozens to ~100 layers: transistors, contacts/vias, lower metals, and upper metals. EUV is used for the smallest, tight-pitch layers; DUV handles larger features cost-effectively.

### Takeaway
Manufacturing is iterative: a thousand precise steps over months transform bare wafers into fully wired systems.

### EUV vs DUV Placement
- EUV: smallest pitches (e.g., cuts, via layers, lower metals)
- DUV: larger-pitch routing, power distribution, top layers

### Cycle Control
- Critical dimension (CD) uniformity and overlay are tracked every layer
- In-line metrology feeds back to exposure, focus, and etch recipes
